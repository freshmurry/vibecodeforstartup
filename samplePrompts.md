Please build a tool/dashboard for me for evaluating various LLM models and comparing their performances side by side - in terms of latency and token generation speed (assume 1 token ~ 4 chars or 0.75 words). I should be able to add custom model names, set custom baseUrl and apiKey per model etc from UI itself.
I should also be able to evaluate all these models together in parallel on various tasks such as code generation or text generation (I should give a single prompt and have all models work on it in parallel with streaming output, and see how fast they work). The generated code should not be attempted to be executed. Whatever the output for all the models, I should also be able to ask a 'judge' model to evaluate and give rating to each model's output w.r.t each other.
Thus this should be a complete LLM testing/sandboxing environment
